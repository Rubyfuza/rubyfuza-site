## Installation

[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) is built on Ruby and uses the [RubyGems package manager] (https://rubygems.org/pages/download) for installation. These are usually pre-installed on Mac OS X and Linux. Windows users can install both using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/).

```
gem install middleman
```

Pull down the repo and then install all the nessessary gems with [bundler](http://bundler.io/)

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:rubyfuza/rubyfuza.gitlab.io.git

cd into the repo

bundle
```

## Middleman Server and Build

Change directories into your new project and start the preview server:

```
cd into the repo
middleman server
```

The preview server allows you to build your site, by modifying the contents of the `source` directory, and see your changes reflected in the browser at: `http://localhost:4567/`

Live-reload is enabled so you won't need to reload your browser or reset the serever for content / style changes. You will however if you have installed a new gem.

To get started, simply develop as you normally would by building HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the `source` directory.

Finally, you will want to build your project into a static site. From the project directory:

```
middleman build
```

Middleman has been configured to complie the site into the `public_html` folder, this folder will then be served through a Heroku / Rackapp / Puma setup.

```

## Building the site 

RubyFuza is running on Gitlab pages, it's a free service offered by gitlab for static sites. I have set up the pipeline so that all you have to do is create a pull request
and the branch if successfully built will automatically deploy live, if it fails then it will notify you that it has failed. 

The task simply shells out to call `middleman build` which builds the site automatically. Middleman will output all files to the configured directory `./public_html`.

## Serving the site

The site is currently being served by gitlab pages. #NOTE: When the build is successful it can take between 2 - 10 minutes for the changes to reflect on the site.

## Contributing

The site is usually maintained by the Ruby community, pull requests welcome
