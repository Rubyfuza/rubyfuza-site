During this time I was introduced to Ruby and I never looked back! For the last year I've been employing these Ruby, Rails and other web-development skills working in the market research industry.
            %h3 What the Duck?
            %p In this talk I explore ways in which to make optimal use of duck typing and type conversion in everyday Ruby programs. I will explore what duck-typing really means, and when it is appropriate to use this as opposed to respond_to?, type checking or type conversion in Ruby programs. I will investigate the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion, and will also take a look at the difference between these conversion protocols and capitalized conversion functions.

            %p Daniel Schierbeck has been programming in Ruby since 2005 after completing level 99 in PHP and figuring out there was no prize to win after all.
            %p He studied Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, where he primarily spent his time trying to avoid writing C++. He got into Concurrent Sequential Processes before it became cool, and wrote a Ruby implementation called Minx for his bachelor thesis. As with all academic code, it is used by no one at all.
            %p He works as a Principal Engineer at Zendesk, a San Francisco based Customer Support Software SaaS company.
            %h3 Using Apache Kafka from Ruby
            %p Apache Kafka is “publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log” – a way for applications to produce messages that can be read by many different consumers. Kafka is rapidly gaining wide adoption, partly because of its impressive scalability but also because of what it enables: looser coupling between message producers and consumers & efficient storage of messages, allowing consumers to “go back in time”.
            %p Until recently, there hasn’t been a battle-tested Ruby client for Kafka, though. We decided to build one, enabling advanced Kafka applications in pure Ruby.

            %h3 Hacking with Ruby
            %p There are many excellent tools out there for “hacking” and penetration testing, some of which are written in Ruby. Looking at two of these tools, Metasploit and Meterpreter, I will explore the area of buffer overflow exploits, to allow the attacker to gain access to the target system through a reverse_tcp payload. The target system in this case should be a Rails server.

            %p Aslam has been building software for long enough to make peace with the fact that design is ridiculously difficult and a whole lot of fun. After 20 odd years, he still finds a way to work at the extremes - close to the metal with lines of code and close to the brain with strategy. Mostly, though, he is just a another software developer from Africa - by birth and by choice. He occasionally blogs at http://aslamkhan.net.
            %h3 From grammar to byte-code in 20 minutes
            %p This is an insane attempt to share the steps and toolchain to build your own external DSL using ruby. The question has to be "Why?" We know how to build internal DSL's in ruby. However, external DSL's give freedom to design a grammar that is free of idiomatic ruby. That opens up a universe of possibilities. Our history of learning compiler theory is mostly painful, but the tools that exist make this viable. This is a tough talk. Like many tough things, it's laced with equal parts of stupidity.

How to automate code reviews and prevent developers from shooting themselves in the foot? We've built a lot of internal tooling around developer environment which I'd like to share in my talk.

            %p Rob started programming in high school where he swore he would never do it again. Five years later he decided to give it another go this time with Ruby, He has never looked back. He is currently at Prodigy Finance, working with an amazing team doing great things. If programmers were superheroes, Rob would be Batman. He may not have any real "superpowers", but he does have several gems on his belt and a few years experience cleaning up Gotham; one bug at a time.
            %h3 Date night with Ruby
            %p We all have that one language that we just love coding in. When presented with a small project it's the tool we would prefer using, that fun language. For me that language is Ruby.
            %p I asked myself a question: Why does working on Ruby projects at work feel so different from working on projects when I am doing something at home, events, hackathons or the like?
            %p I asked this question to many developers, their answers have lead me to rediscover my relationship with Ruby. Let me show you how I found the joy of programming in Ruby.

          .inner
            %p For 17 or so years I have been building software - developing, managing, leading and mentoring others. My current focus is around successfully keeping code fluid and able to change through building a deeper understanding of agile development practices, principles and values while coaching developers and teams to do the same. For the last several years this has been while working on Ruby / Rails applications.
            %h3 Building a learning culture.
            %p Experience is valuable.  How do you harness the experience and skill you have in your organisation for everyone’s benefit?  How do you extract the learnings gained from experiencing the pain and joy from living in the trenches?
            %p This talk will focus on building a joint understanding of software values and principles in order to build a shared view of why we build the things we build the way we build them. It will delve into some of the activities that we are doing in an organisation of 18 (and growing) ruby developers - what worked, what didn’t and what we hope to try next.
