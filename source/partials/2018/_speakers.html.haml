            %h3 Orbital Rocket Guidance with Ruby
            %p Let’s make Ruby go fast - 18,000 MPH fast! Using the popular space simulator Kerbal Space Program and some remote procedure calls, we’re going to use Ruby to launch (simulated) rockets into space. Using the algorithms and techniques developed for the Apollo Guidance Computer, we’ll write a program that can manage several tasks concurrently but also survive hard restarts and unplanned errors. Finally, we’ll launch a Saturn V rocket, controlled by a Ruby program that emulates space computers of the past.
