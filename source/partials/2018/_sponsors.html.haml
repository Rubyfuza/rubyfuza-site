          %p In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

          %p On OfferZen instead of applying for jobs, companies send you interview requests with upfront salary details. You decide which companies to interview with by comparing salary, the work you’ll be doing, learning opportunities, work environment, and perks that companies offer.
          %p We made OfferZen to be exactly what we would want:
          %ul.list
            %li No recruiters involved ever - deal directly with the company.
            %li We manually approve all companies to make sure only awesome companies are hiring on OfferZen.
            %li You get multiple interview requests with upfront salary info - so you can see what you’re worth.
            %li Your email isn't shared with anyone - no spam ever.
            %li Your profile is hidden from everyone except from companies we’ve approved.
            %li Your current employer is blocked from seeing you.
